Transfer-Learning using Ktrain

ktrain is a lightweight wrapper for the deep learning library Keras (and other libraries) to help build, train, and deploy neural networks. With only a few lines of code, ktrain allows you to easily and quickly:

1. Estimate an optimal learning rate for your model given your data using a Learning Rate Finder
2. utilize learning rate schedules such as the triangular policy, the 1cycle policy, and SGDR to effectively minimize loss and improve generalization.
